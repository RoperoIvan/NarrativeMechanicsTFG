# Narrative Game Mechanics Prototype

This repository is dedicated to the development of the prototype used as tool to investigate the use of narrative game mechanics in videogames.

This prototype is named No talk in here, you are a soldier of a submarine which has been attacked by an enemy ship. All your comrades are dead and you are the last one alive in the submarine. Now you will have the chance to solve the conflict, you can talk to the enemy communicating with them through visual signaling or to follow orders by your allies through the radio communications. You will have to manage your time and take fast decisions to make it through.

## Controls

No talk in here is played with the mouse. The events will run across the screen in the time line when they execute you will have an specific amount of time to enter the indicated room to communicate or repair the submarine.

Red means attack: go to the calibration screen and fix the orientation of the submarine or go to the repair screen and close the holes made in the hull before you drown.
Blue means radio: go to the radio screen to communicate to the allies. You will have to check the frequencies to understand what they are saying. Then answer with the button afirmative or negative.
Green means visual: go to the visual screen to communicate with the enemy. The enemy will show a combination of 4 flags which will have a meaning that can be checked in the manual of the screen. Then you will have to answer with another combination of flags. Be careful, if they interpret your message as a provocation they will send an immediate attack and will begin to open the missil launcher.

Each time you communicate with one of the sides their position relative to you will change, from here is your decision to know how it will end. The conflict ends pacifically, you shoot them, they shoot you, your allies attack first, you drown... It's up to you.
